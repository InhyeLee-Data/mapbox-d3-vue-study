# vue-d3-geo (1)
It is a project, following Alec Barrett's MSDV Major Studio 2 Example
- Using d3-geo and mapbox together on the same page of vue: https://github.com/anbnyc/major-studio-2-sp21/tree/main/05-geo 

In this version, a separate component is created for a d3-geo instance, yet the mapboxgl instance is still part of the main App.vue.
